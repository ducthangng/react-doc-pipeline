# This step is very important to be executed before copying the rest of the applicationâ€™s 
# code to the container. This is because while Docker is building, it creates intermediate 
# containers for every step/command and caches it. So, if nothing different has been added 
# to that container, it will use the cached container instead of re-executing that step. 
# But, if something has changed, it will re-execute every command after the one that changed.
